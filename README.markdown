jasmine-maven-plugin
====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin.png)](http://travis-ci.org/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin?branch=master)

For information on how to use the jasmine-maven-plugin, check out its [documentation page](http://searls.github.com/jasmine-maven-plugin/).

## Current Version Info

You can find the latest release along with release notes [here](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin/releases).

The plugin's version numbering will mirror the version of Jasmine that backs it (with a version number tacked on at the end that tracks changes to the plugin within a Jasmine release). The latest version of the plugin points to Jasmine 1.3.1, so its version number is **1.3.1.X**. 

If you want to point at snapshot releases of the plugin (note that I don't deploy them often), they're hosted on the [Sonatype OSS snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/snapshots).
