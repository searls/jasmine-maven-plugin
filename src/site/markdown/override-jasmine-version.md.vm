# Overriding Jasmine Version

The `${project.artifactId}` comes with Jasmine `${jasmineVersion}` but you can easily override that version. For instance, if you wanted to use Jasmine `2.1.3` just configure the plugin like this:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>com.github.searls</groupId>
  <artifactId>jasmine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${currentStableVersion}<version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>test</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.webjars.bower</groupId>
      <artifactId>jasmine</artifactId>
      <version>2.1.3</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</plugin>
```

Please do understand that while this will override the version there is no guarantee that the plugin will work with the version you want to use. For the best stability it is recommended you stick with the version that the plugin is built and tested with.
