Feature: setting custom includes & excludes

  In order to accommodate with complex hierarchies and dependency loading issues
  I want to set custom includes and excludes of my sources and specs

  Scenario: a project with a simple set of excludes

    Given I am currently in the "jasmine-webapp-basic-excludes" project
    When I run "../../../../mvnw clean test"
    Then the build should succeed

  Scenario: a project limited to explicit includes

    Given I am currently in the "jasmine-webapp-basic-includes" project
    When I run "../../../../mvnw clean test"
    Then the build should succeed
    And I should see "Results: 3 specs, 0 failures"
